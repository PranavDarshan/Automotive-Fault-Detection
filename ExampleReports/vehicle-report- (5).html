            <p class="my-2"><strong>Engine Health Report</strong></p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">1. Overall Engine Health Summary</h1>The engine health report indicates a critical condition, requiring immediate attention to prevent a potential breakdown. The confidence level suggests a 99% possibility of engine breakdown, emphasizing the need for urgent maintenance within the next 1-7 days.</p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">2. Sensor Data Analysis</h1>The provided sensor data reveals several areas of concern:</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Engine RPM</strong>: At 1 RPM, the engine is not operating within normal parameters, indicating a potential issue with the ignition system or fuel supply.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Lube Oil Pressure</strong>: The lube oil pressure is at 1, which is lower than the recommended range, potentially causing engine seizure or damage to moving parts.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Fuel Pressure</strong>: Similar to the lube oil pressure, the fuel pressure is at 1, which may result in poor engine performance, misfires, or failure to start.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Coolant Pressure</strong>: The coolant pressure is at 0, indicating a potential leak in the cooling system or a malfunctioning coolant pump, which can lead to overheating and engine damage.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Lube Oil Temperature</strong>: The lube oil temperature is at 1, which is lower than the recommended range, potentially causing viscosity issues and affecting engine lubrication.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Coolant Temperature</strong>: The coolant temperature is at 0, suggesting that the engine is not operating at a normal temperature, which can be due to a faulty thermostat or a malfunctioning cooling system.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Transmission and Type</strong>: The vehicle is a manual transmission sedan with a mileage of 111 km, which is relatively low. However, the current issues are not directly related to the transmission type or mileage.</p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">3. Confidence Level Explanation</h1>The confidence level of 99% indicates a high likelihood of engine breakdown based on the sensor data analysis. This confidence level is calculated using advanced algorithms that consider various engine parameters and their impact on the overall engine health. The high confidence level suggests that immediate action is necessary to prevent engine failure.</p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">4. Potential Issues and Diagnostics</h1>Based on the sensor data analysis, potential issues include:</p><p class="my-2">• Low engine RPM, potentially due to ignition system or fuel supply issues.</p><p class="my-2">• Insufficient lube oil pressure, which may cause engine seizure or damage.</p><p class="my-2">• Inadequate fuel pressure, resulting in poor engine performance or failure to start.</p><p class="my-2">• Coolant system malfunction, potentially causing engine overheating and damage.</p><p class="my-2">• Abnormal lube oil and coolant temperatures, affecting engine performance and longevity.</p><p class="my-2">Diagnostics should focus on inspecting the ignition system, fuel pump, lube oil system, coolant system, and temperature control systems to identify the root causes of these issues.</p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">5. Maintenance Recommendations</h1>To prevent engine breakdown, the following maintenance tasks are recommended:</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Immediate Inspection</strong>: Inspect the ignition system, fuel pump, lube oil system, coolant system, and temperature control systems to identify any malfunctions or leaks.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Fluid Checks</strong>: Check the lube oil and coolant levels, and top them off as necessary.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Pressure Tests</strong>: Perform pressure tests on the lube oil and fuel systems to identify any leaks or blockages.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Temperature System Check</strong>: Verify that the thermostat is functioning correctly, and the cooling system is operating within normal parameters.</p><p class="my-2">• <strong>Engine RPM Check</strong>: Investigate the cause of the low engine RPM and take corrective action to ensure the engine operates within the recommended range.</p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">6. Performance Trends</h1>The current sensor data indicates a critical engine condition. However, as there is no historical data provided, it is challenging to establish performance trends. Regular monitoring of engine parameters and maintenance records can help identify trends and prevent future issues.</p><p class="my-2"><h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">7. Alerts or Warnings</h1><strong>URGENT ACTION REQUIRED</strong>: The engine is at risk of imminent breakdown due to critical issues with the lube oil pressure, fuel pressure, coolant pressure, and temperature control systems. Immediate maintenance is necessary to prevent costly repairs and ensure the engine's longevity.</p>
